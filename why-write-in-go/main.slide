* What is Go?
- General-purpose language 
- Strongly typed
- Garbage collected
- Explicit support for concurrency
- Compiles to executable binary
- Open source, by Google

* Why was the language created

Motivation:
- Software Infrastructure scale issues @ Google
- Frustrating large C/C++ codebases
- Long build times
- Bad tooling

Goals:
- Support for networked/multicore computing
- Simple and elegant, yet high performance 
- Quick compilation time for large codebases

* Historical Context
- Authors: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson
- Whiteboarding started September 2007 while waiting for large C++ builds to run
- Russ Cox joined in late 2008. He helped move the language and libraries from prototype to reality.
- Go 1.0 was released in March 2012
- Became open sourced on November 10, 2009

* But really, why write in Go?

- Great for building microservices
- Small memory/disk overhead
- Great tooling for development and testing
- Simple, easy to learn - 25 keywords
- Native support for concurrency
- Many major projects written in Go
- Amazing community and Mascot

* Building Microservices
.code code/go-microservice/main.go

* Small memory/disk overhead
- Go vs. Java memory/disk usage
- Deployed two hello world microservices in Go and Java both exposing a REST API

* Tooling
Built in tools such as...
- [[https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/][go fmt]], Standardized auto formating
- [[https://github.com/golang/lint][golint]], Linter 
- [[https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports][goimports]], Auto imports
- [[https://golang.org/pkg/testing][go test]], Built in testing
- [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof][pprof]], Profiling and benchmarking
- many community ones

* Easy to learn
Designed to be simple and readable

Only 25 keywords

    break        default      func         interface    select
    case         defer        go           map          struct
    chan         else         goto         package      switch
    const        fallthrough  if           range        type
    continue     for          import       return       var

* Concurrency - Goroutines
.play code/concurrency/main.go

* Concurrency - Channels 
.play code/channels/main.go

* Concurrency - Much mroe 
- Wait groups
- Mutex
- Buffered channels
- etc
